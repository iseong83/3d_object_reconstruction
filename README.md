# Insight Project: 3D Object Reconstruction
This is work for the Insight Project. Many deep learning algorithms use 2.5D images, which including depth map, to predict 3D. This project  uses multiple images with different views to reconstruct 3D image instead of using the depth map. For this, 3D-R2N2 ([paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00449)) has been used. 
Since the official source code ([link](https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2.git)) is implemented Theano, this project uses the Tensoflow implementation in [here](https://github.com/micmelesse/3D-reconstruction-with-Neural-Networks.git). 

# Week 1
- [ ] Test the Tensorflow code
- [ ] Decide dataset: a single category only? or train with multiple categories
